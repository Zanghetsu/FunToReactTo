# React Repository

## Introduction

This repository is not much of a designated storage for a well outlined project, but more like an experimental stage, that hopes to result in a front end application that retrieves and filtes and represents real time financial data in the range of  crypto currencies, forex, and stock information.

Many branch of this product will not bear fruit that will be merged into the main/deployment, altough they will enbody many practices and alternative solutions for the same problem, part as the lurning curve of setting up personal preferencies in front end development ( selecting and utilizing different libs to alternately solve the same problems )

As of now only the goal is clear, this projects development can be described as agile, as trough every dev cycle some features will eather et refactored, or replaced by different solution.

## Requirements

As this is an application created with Node Package Manager, the best way to describe the requirements would be to insert the official description whis is :

 
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
